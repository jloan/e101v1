# Big Picture

Our first project this quarter will be to compose a personal blog. Blogs are a genre of digital writing   that you still find today in the wilds of the internet, although they've changed a bit since the early days -- the 1990s! We're going to go "old school" and party like its 1999...we're going to make a personal blog.

![Back to The Old School]()

And...if you want to get all offical about it -- this project fits squarely into our first course outcome:

> Compose work in a variety of genres, including but not limited to thesis-driven, college-level essays that synthesize researched sources (3,500 words minimum of formal writing, total, excluding revisions) by using the writing process.

Guess what? Blogs are a *genre*. So there!

In all seriousness, we'll use blogs to learn a little something about genres, rhetorical situations, our own writing processes, information compentency, the decentralized web...even...citations! So relax. It's gonna be alright.


## Why a blog? Really...what's the purpose of this?

Good question! I think blogs offer us an interesting starting point. They're traditionally a word driven genre so in many ways they resemble the more traditional forms of writing, like essays or papers, that we have some experience with in school. So for those of you anxious about improving your grammar or sentence structure -- a blog offers you a space to do this. But blogs are also very different from the papers and essays we traditionally write in school. First, blogs were made to be public, not simply written for a teacher. Traditionally people who started blogs did so because they wanted a platform to reach an audience they had in mind about topics that mattered to them and the communities they felt they were a part of. Second, blogs are a "born digital" genre. They easily allow you to experiment with multimedia writing, which is just a fancy way of saying you can compose with compbinations of words, images, and sounds. This means that you can develop some new information comptencies around composing in digital spaces.

There are plenty of [other reasons](http://www.kathleenamorris.com/2018/03/14/benefits-blogging/) to blog, even in school -- you don't have to just take my word for it.

## Part One (Let's get Started)

The first thing we are going to do is set up a blog at [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com). You want to set-up the free account. Don't pay for anything. If you get really into this blogging thing and want to go "premium" at some point, come talk to me, I can point you in some directions.

Once you have an account set-up, you can pretty much start blogging. **But before you dive in...**

Take some time to do a couple of things:

* Consider what you might blog about? Can you come up with and articulate a purpose for your blog?
* Check out these two personal blogs -- Black.Bunched.Mass.Mom. and Spitalfields Life. Be sure to check out the "about" pages. Consider how these writers have defined a purpose for their blogging.
* Use the Wordpress dashboard (once you have an account) to explore other Wordpress blogs. Again, consider how the writers of these blogs have articulated their purpose for writing.


### DUE FRIDAY (Jan. 10 -- start of class)

* Have your Wordpress blog set up. By Friday, your blog should have an "About" page that articulates the purpose/focus of your blog and at least 2 posts. Posts can be about anything, but they should relate to the purpose that you articulated for your blog.
* **A Note on Privacy/Sharing**: Wordpress gives you options for how public or private you want to make your blog. You may choose to keep your blog private to only readers you choose, but I am going to ask you to share it with me and at least a small group of your classmates. I would also encourage you to share your blog with your network of friends or people beyond the class that you think might be interested in reading it.


## Part Two (Diving Deeper)

In the next phase of the project, we're going to consider blogs as a genre a genre a little more closely.

###Do this...

I want you to do some reading *about* blogs. By Wednesday [Jan. 14] give these a read:

* Brian Neese's ["History of Blogging: A Timeline"](https://online.ndm.edu/news/communication/history-of-blogging/). The purpose of this reading is to give you a snapshot of the history of blogs.
* James Hardy's ["Blogging, Where Web Blogs Came From."](https://historycooperative.org/the-history-of-blogs/) The purpose of this reading is that it adds a little more commentary to the Nesse's timeline.
* Onur Kabadayi's ["Blogging is Dead, long live blogging."](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jul/16/blogging-dead-bloggers-digital-content) The purpose of this reading is to give you sense of how traditional blogs, like the ones we're writing are potentially "dead." I told you blogs were old school.
* Mark C. Marino's ["Teaching Writing in the Post-bloggging Era."](https://medium.com/@markcmarino/teaching-writing-in-the-post-blogging-era-ab7848247e33) The purpose of this reading is to introduce the idea of a "post-blogging era" and why we might still teach with them (or not).
* Dan Cohen's ["Back to the Blog."](https://dancohen.org/2018/03/21/back-to-the-blog/) The purpose of this reading is offer you a glimpse at why, even though traditional blogging might be "dead," that people are returning to the practice and why that might be important.

What?!!! Five readings!?!? I know it seems like a lot. But each one is pretty short. Make a plan. Do a little bit at a time. Don't feel like you have to memorize them or anything. Do your best with it. We'll work together with them in class.

### Also do this...

I also want you to keep working on and developing your own blog.

**Write at least 3 more posts.**

In these 3 new posts, experiment with this:

* Each new post should be at least 300 words long. longer is fine too. (Wordpress has a word count feature.) This means by the end of Week 2 two of the quarter, you'll have at least 5 posts on your blob totalling over 1,000 words of writing! How about that, huh? Awesome.
* At least one of your new posts should include an image (or other media).
* At least one of your new posts should hyperlink to and quote from another piece of writing on the web. For example, if you were writing a post about [Kendrick Lamar winning a Pulitzer Prize](https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/04/kendrick-lamar-damn-wins-pulitzer-prize/), you might quote from and link to an interview that Lamar gave about winning the award.


## Part Two Recap

### DUE Wednesday [Jan. 14 - start of class]

* Some readings on blogs (see above).

### DUE Friday [Jan. 17]

* At 3 new blog posts experiment with various features of the genre (multimedia writing, hyperlinking, ect.)
