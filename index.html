      <h2>Welcome to English 101</h2>

<p>Glad you're here.</p>

<p>This course asks you to consider your experiences of composing -- the knowledge you bring to the class about language and communication -- and how they might be combined with other perspectives on writing/composing in order to make something new.</p>

<p>We meet daily from 10:00 - 10:50 in SNR 112. If you are enrolled in the Accelerated Learning Program (099). we'll also have support lab sessions on M and W from 11 - 11:50.</p>



<p>Email (jloan@pierce.ctc.edu) is the best way to contact me. Typically, you can expect a reply to an email within 24 hours; however, response times for emails received over the weekend will vary and may not receive a reply until Monday.</p>

<p>I do have an office phone. The # is 253-964-6312. </p> 

<p>My office is in Cascade 357. Stopping in to see me during my office hours or making an appointment to meet with me are both an expectation and a great way to have questions answered, receive feedback and to talk about the work of our course. I will do my best throughout the semester to work with you so, again, donâ€™t hesitate to initiate a conversation.</p>

<p>My office hours this quarter are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12 - 2 or by appointment.<p>
