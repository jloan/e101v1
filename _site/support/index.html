  <h1 class="page-title">Support</h1>
  <h2 id="basic-needs-security">BASIC NEEDS SECURITY</h2>

<p>Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact one of Pierce’s growing number of <a href="https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/help">support services</a>. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I may possess.</p>

<p>In short, if you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.</p>

<h2 id="faith-and-conscious">FAITH AND CONSCIOUS</h2>

<p>Reasonable Accommodations for Faith/Conscience: Students who will be absent from or endure significant hardship in course activities due to reasons of faith or conscience may seek reasonable accommodations so that grades are not impacted. Such requests must be made in writing within the first two weeks of the beginning of the course. Students should review the Accommodations for Faith/Conscience Policy and follow the procedures.</p>

<h2 id="equity-diversity-and-inclusion">EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION</h2>

<p>My goal is to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Pierce records, please let me know.</p>

<p>Creating this environment also includes my commitment to value the diversity of our language practices. School for many is often a place where judgements about language have been harnessed both intentionally and unintentionally to marginalize people and set-up barriers to success. The composition classroom is a place where we can come to more critically understand how language plays a role in issues of inclusion/exclusion in the world.</p>

<p>I (like all us) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, as a participant in course discussions and work, I expect you to also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.</p>

<h1 id="resources">RESOURCES</h1>
<p>From Access and Disability Services (ADS) to Multicultural Services to Tutoring, a variety of support services exist at Pierce College.</p>

<p>Our goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive, and welcoming.  If you have or think you may have a disability that may affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact Access and Disability Services at ADS@pierce.ctc.edu or (253) 964-6468 to see if you are eligible to receive services. If you are already approved for accommodations through the ADS, have requested your accommodations for this quarter and would like to use your accommodations in my class please connect with me outside of class time to discuss your needs.</p>

<p>If you are not sure where to go please speak with me so I can help you get where you want to go. If I do not know the answer to a question I will always be more than happy to help you find out who does have an answer.</p>

<p>Another good starting point is also the Support Services page on the Pierce College website.
Again, do not hesitate to have a conversation with me about support and services. Your success is important to me and I’m willing to help you find what you need.</p>

<h2 id="emergency-procedures">Emergency Procedures</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to know and understand emergency procedures. In the event of an emergency call 911 as soon as it is safe to do so, if possible also call Campus Safety at 253-964-6751 (Fort Steilacoom) or 253-840-8481 (Puyallup).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Escorts- Safety escorts are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (not available at JBLM). Call Campus Safety in Puyallup at 253-840-8481, at Fort Steilacoom 253-964-6751.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fire Alarm- During an emergency evacuation, take your valuables ONLY if it is safe to do so. You could put yourself or someone else at risk by delaying your exit. Plan to return to class once the alarm has stopped. Do not return until you have received an official all-clear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earthquake- DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON. Once the shaking stops, take your valuables and leave the building. Do not plan to return for the rest of the day. Do not return to the building until you have received an official all-clear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Active Shooter- RUN, HIDE, FIGHT; run if possible, hide and/or barricade if escape is not possible, fight as a last resort. Most classroom and lab doors are kept locked. If you decide to barricade in a classroom or lab know how to secure the door so it is locked. This may be done by pulling the door fully closed or by sliding the lock block and pulling the door closed. Know how the door locks ahead of time.</p>
