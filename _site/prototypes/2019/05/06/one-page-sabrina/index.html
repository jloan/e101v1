  <h1 class="post-title">Interpretive prototype #2: Draw/Prototype a One-Page Comic in Response to Sabrina</h1>
  <span class="post-date">by Jason Loan - 06 May 2019</span>
  
  <h2 id="prototyping-about-sabrina-an-experiment">Prototyping About <em>Sabrina</em> (an Experiment)</h2>

<p>We began the quarter with a reading and discussion of <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/prototype/"><em>prototyping</em> as an approach</a> to doing work in the humanities. As a starting point for this work we prototyped a response to Kathleen Yancey’s <a href="https://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/2852">“Writing in the 21st Century.”</a></p>

<p>The case I made to you about prototyping as part of our work in an English class was that prototyping encourages us to create/develop what does not yet exist, and in the work of writing about literarure, our goal is to pose and explore questions that may not yet exist. When we write about literature, our challenge is to go beyond a simple summary of what happened in a particular work, and to create new and interesting queations to explore in relation to that work.</p>

<h2 id="heres-your-challenge">Here’s Your Challenge</h2>

<h4 id="drawprototype-a-one-page-comic-in-response-to-sabrina">Draw/Prototype a One-Page Comic in Response to <em>Sabrina</em></h4>

<p>This week we will be making a variation of Brunetti’s “Week 9: Homework Assignment 9.” In Brunetti’s original assignment he asks us to draw a one-page story. Our variation will be to <em>draw a one-page prototype in response to Sabrina</em>.</p>

<p>The general guidelines will remain the same.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use any layout and any number of panels that you wish.</li>
  <li>The final size should be 11X17 inches, even if reduced.</li>
  <li>Either horizontal or vertical format is OK.</li>
  <li>Include a title in the composition.</li>
  <li>Not counting black and white and grey, use at least one additional color. You may use as many additional colors as you like and apply them using whichever tools you feel comfortable using.</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful one-page comics/prototypes will explore some key aspect or deminsion of <em>Sabrina</em> and attempt to evoke some of the book’s complexity in an effort to generate new questions about the work.</p>

<p>Your one-page page protoype might explore any number of things in response to <em>Sabrina</em>, but here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compose a speculative “deleted scene” from Drnaso’s book. Attempt to adhere as closely as you can to the stylistic choices made by Drnaso.</li>
  <li>Compose an “unseen” scene that develops a minor character that appears only briefly, or momentarily in the original book.</li>
  <li>Compose a variation of an existing scene by altering a key element of what makes it a comic. For example – reimagine a scene from <em>Sabrina</em> in which you change the levels of realism and abstraction. Or reimagine a squence in the book using a differnt approach to pacing and time. Essentially, pick a cartooning/comics concept from McCloud or Brunetti and reimagine a key scene in <em>Sabrina</em> by substanively altering how Drnaso employed that element.</li>
  <li>Compose a McCloud-esque one-page essay in respone to <em>Sabrina</em>. In other words, draw yourself as a character offering critical commentary on Drnaso’s text.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a handful of possibilities. There are no doubt others, and I encourage you to be as creative and experimental in your prototype as you’re able. I also encourage you to look back at the “Speculative Soundtrack” you made last week for <em>Sabrina</em>. What ideas or questions emerged for you in that work that you could further explore in this experiment?</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-tools-and-technology">A Note on Tools and Technology</h2>

<p>In Brunetti’s “Syllabus” he offers “A few words on computers.” Brunetti encourages us to learn cartooning via what he calls “low-tech, traditional media” and by which he means primarily pens and paper. I appreciate Brunetti’s insistance on this, particularly because what he is mostly after is hekping students avoid using computersa and other high-tech tools as shortcuts. That said, for our own experiment, I would encourage you to work with whatever tools and materials you might find useful. For example, maybe you want to use some collage tecniques – literally cutting and pasting things – as part of your prototype work. Go for it. Or, you might find that tracing elements from <em>Sabrina</em> proves useful for your prototype.</p>

<p>I think we should feel okay expanding our toolbox beyond pen and paper. I do expect though, that whatever tools you might use (either “low” or “high” tech), that you will adhere to the spirit of Brunetti’s course and use the tool because it helps you do something interesting with your prototype and not simply a “short-cut.” Remember, the strength of your prototype will mot necessarily be in the quality of your drawing ability, although manu of you have quite good cartoonists hands. The strength of your prototype will be in the complexity of its ideas in responding to <em>Sabrina</em>.</p>
