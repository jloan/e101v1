  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>One of the mantras of this course is that composing is situational. This means that the reasons we compose, and what ultimately makes for good or successful composing, relies in large part on the situation, or context, that the act of composing is done in response to. This is lesson one. If today or at the end of the quarter anyone asks you what you learned – hopefully, at least one answer you will be able to offer is: composing is situational.</p>

<p>There are, of course, a multitude of situations that might prompt composing. The need to sell a product provides a situation for composing an ad campaign. A relative’s passing and the desire to remember their cooking provides a situation for composing a self-published cookbook to share favorite recipes with family and friends.</p>

<p>A challenge of any composition class is to provide situations that allow students to develop their own purposes for composing. So, while as the teacher I have designed the projects that will guide us, my ultimate goal – and the purpose for this course – is to help students identify their own situations and purposes for composing both within and beyond our classroom.</p>

<h2 id="departmental-outcomes">Departmental Outcomes</h2>

<p>The English Department has defined a set of learning outcomes for our course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compose work in a variety of genres, including but not limited to thesis-driven, college-level essays that synthesize researched sources (3,500 words minimum of formal writing, total, excluding revisions) by using the writing process.</li>
  <li>Apply key rhetorical concepts (writer, audience, subject, purpose, and context) in order to analyze and compose a variety of texts.</li>
  <li>Analyze texts as purposeful responses to a variety of situations and contexts as well as products of social identity (e.g., gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class).</li>
  <li>Use rhetorically appropriate English language structures, including disciplinary conventions of syntax, grammar, punctuation, spelling voice, tone, and diction.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate information competency by locating, reading, and evaluating a diverse range of primary and secondary research materials (both scholarly and popular) in order to synthesize original ideas with those from appropriate sources.</li>
  <li>Quote, paraphrase, cite and document sources appropriately in a consistent documentation style to maintain academic honesty and intellectual integrity.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="your-learning-outcomes">Your Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>My goal is that the work in this class is also rooted in the learning outcomes that you can define for yourself. Throughout the class we will work on how to identify and define these outcomes. Imagine a section here for these:</p>

<ol>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="required-textsmaterials">Required Texts/Materials</h2>

<p>We have no required text in this class. We will, however, occasionally have both assigned and self-selected readings. These will be posted to the course schedule and made available as needed.
We will also use a handful of digital tools such as Google Docs and Zotero. These tools will either be free or available for you access via our classroom and campus.</p>

<h2 id="our-projects">Our Projects</h2>

<p>This quarter you will compose in multiple genres and multiple media. These projects will include, but may not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blogs</li>
  <li>essays</li>
  <li>podcasts</li>
  <li>zines</li>
  <li>annotated bibliographies</li>
  <li>research logs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<p>More detailed instructions for these projects will provided.</p>

<p>In all our work this quarter we will engage in processes of drafting, feedback and revision. We want to become better aware of how our work interacts with audiences and how it can possibly do useful work for these audiences in the world.</p>
