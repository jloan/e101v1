# Some Context

One of the mantras of this course is that composing is situational. This means that the reasons we compose, and what ultimately makes for good or successful composing, relies in large part on the situation, or context, that the act of composing is done in response to. This is lesson one. If today or at the end of the quarter anyone asks you what you learned -- hopefully, at least one answer you will be able to offer is: composing is situational.
 
There are, of course, a multitude of situations that might prompt composing. The need to sell a product provides a situation for composing an ad campaign. A relative's passing and the desire to remember their cooking provides a situation for composing a self-published cookbook to share favorite recipes with family and friends.

A challenge of any composition class is to provide situations that allow students to develop their own purposes for composing. So, while as the teacher I have designed the projects that will guide us, my ultimate goal is to help students identify their own situations and purposes for composing both within and beyond our classroom.
